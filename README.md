# CTF Write-Up

Welcome to the CTF Write-Up repository! This repository contains write-ups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that I have participated in, with a primary focus on web vulnerabilities. The write-ups detail the methods and techniques used to solve the challenges, along with any relevant notes and resources.


## Challenges

The challenges included in this repository cover a variety of web vulnerabilities, such as:

- **SQL Injection**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
- **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**
- **Security Misconfigurations**
- **MORE...**

Each challenge has its own directory with a detailed write-up explaining the approach taken to solve it, including steps for exploitation, screenshots, and any tools used.
